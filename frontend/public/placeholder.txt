To complete the branding update, you should create:

1. logo192.png - A 192x192 pixel PNG version of your logo (based on the SVG favicon we created)
2. logo512.png - A 512x512 pixel PNG version of your logo

You can use any image editor that can export SVGs to PNG, like:
- Inkscape (free, open-source)
- Adobe Illustrator
- Figma
- GIMP
- Photoshop

Instructions:
1. Open the favicon.svg file in your preferred image editor
2. Scale it to 192x192 and 512x512 pixels respectively
3. Export as PNG with transparent background
4. Replace the existing logo files in the public directory
